Implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in MIPS Assembly. The nodes are 32 bits (1 word) in length and are stored in an array of size 255 words. Each node has 8 bits for the left node index, 8 bits for the right node index, and 16 bits for the node value. Using these values, I am able to implement preorder traversal, adding nodes, and deleting nodes (all methods are done so recursively if need be).
